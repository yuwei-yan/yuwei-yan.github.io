## About Me

I am Yuwei Yan, a passionate researcher and engineer with a multidisciplinary background in mechanical engineering, biomedical technologies, and innovative design. Holding a Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering Design from the University of Manchester and a Bachelor’s in Weapon Launch Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology, I have cultivated expertise in both theoretical and applied sciences. My professional journey spans roles as a Research Assistant at the University of Sydney’s hBMS Lab, where I contributed to cutting-edge projects in organoid modeling and microfluidics, and as a Mechanical Design Engineer at FiberHome Telecommunication Technologies, where I honed my skills in structural design and quality control.

In August 2025, I embark on a new chapter as a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Macau. My doctoral research will focus on developing a Portable Micro-Detection System for in situ Bacterial Detection in Marine Environments, aiming to address critical challenges in environmental monitoring and public health through advanced engineering solutions.

My work is driven by a commitment to bridging engineering innovation with real-world applications, particularly in healthcare and sustainability. Beyond research, I enjoy collaborating across disciplines, mentoring students, and contributing to open-source engineering projects.

## Research Interests

My projects often integrate computational modeling (ANSYS, Abaqus), additive manufacturing, and experimental validation to deliver scalable solutions.

- **Microfluidics and Biosensors:** Designing lab-on-a-chip systems for disease modeling (e.g., brain organoids, retinal models) and environmental diagnostics.
- **Medical Robotics:** Developing wearable biosensors and bioreactors for tissue engineering applications.
- **Portable Detection Systems:** Creating low-cost, field-deployable devices for rapid pathogen detection, including my upcoming Ph.D. work on marine bacterial monitoring.
- **Biomechatronics:** Exploring brain-computer interfaces and modular robotics for healthcare and aerospace applications.
