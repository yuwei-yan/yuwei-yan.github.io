## Fun Facts

Life often feels like a dense jungle full of unexpected turns, but there's always a path forward if you keep looking. That’s the motto I’ve carried with me through many pivotal moments. In 2019, while studying at BIT, I was honored to be selected as a CSC-funded exchange student to the United States. By that time, the trade war had just started, and due to the 10043 restriction list, I never got the visa to enter the US. So I turned to the other side of the ocean, the UK, where I met my wife. Before graduating from Manchester, I had the pleasure of receiving an offer from the 2012 Lab at Huawei, based in Dongguan. However, motivated by both love and my long-term academic aspirations, I chose instead to return to Wuhan, my wife's hometown, and take a more balanced engineering role at a state-owned company, allowing me time to prepare for future doctoral studies. After two years of work and exam preparation, luckily, I got a full scholarship PhD offer from the University of Sydney. While waiting for my visa, I contributed remotely as a research assistant and co-authored a review paper with the team. Sadly, history repeated itself—not exactly as before, but similarly frustrating. The Australian immigration process stalled indefinitely without a clear rejection or approval. Eventually, I made the difficult decision to let go of that opportunity and start anew. Fortunately, this journey led me to where I am now: a PhD student in Macau. It turned out to be the best choice for both my academic career and family life. Here, I no longer worry about visa issues, and the convenience of high-speed rail allows me to be with my wife and children regularly. The region’s growing potential, especially in the neighboring Zhuhai area, promises exciting prospects for the future. Through it all, I’ve learned to stay optimistic and never look back with regret. Thanks for taking the time to read my story. Wish you a good morning, good afternoon, and good night.
